# ASP.NET WebForms Security Best Practices

This document provides information on some of the best practices developers should follow to avoid certain security breaches. Each section of this document describes a possible use-case scenario that exposes the security issue and the vulnerabilities associated with it, together with information on how to mitigate the security problems.

The security issues are all shown using a simple Visual Studio solution. Fully commented code samples are provided as part of that solution to show how to avoid each security breach. You will need to have DevExpress ASP.NET controls installed in order to load and compile the solution. You can download the installer from the [DevExpress website](https://devexpress.com).

## 1. Uploading Files

**Related Controls**: [ASPxBinaryImage](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/11624/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Data-Editors/Editor-Types/ASPxBinaryImage/Overview/ASPxBinaryImage-Overview), [ASPxUploadControl](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/4040/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/File-Management/File-Upload/Overview/ASPxUploadControl-Overview), [ASPxFileManager](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/9030/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/File-Management/File-Manager/Overview/ASPxFileManager-Overview), [ASPxHtmlEditor](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/4024/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/HTML-Editor), [ASPxRichEdit](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/17721/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Rich-Text-Editor), [ASPxSpreadsheet](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/16157/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Spreadsheet)

**Security Risks**: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html), [CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)
This section provides information on how to provide file upload capabilities within your web application. There are several separate scenarios to cover:

- [1.1. Stop Malicious Files Being Uploaded](#11-prevent-uploading-malicious-files)
- [1.2. Avoid Uncontrolled Resource Consumption](#12-prevent-uncontrolled-resource-consumption)
- [1.3. Protect Temporary Files](#13-protect-temporary-files)

### 1.1. Stop Malicious Files Being Uploaded

Visit the **[UploadingFiles\UploadControl.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingFiles/UploadControl.aspx.cs)** page for a full code sample.

Consider the situation where your web application allows for files to be uploaded. These files are then accessed using a specific URL (for example: _example.com/uploaded/uploaded-filename_).

The possible security breach here occurs when a malicious file is uploaded that can then be executed on the server side. For example, a malefactor could upload an ASPX file containing malicious code and guess at its URL. If the malefactor is correct and requests this URL, the file would be executed on the server as if it were part of the application.

To familiarize yourself with the issue:

1. Comment out the following lines to disable protection.

   [\UploadingFiles\UploadControl.aspx:](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingFiles/UploadControl.aspx)

   ```aspx
   <%-- <ValidationSettings AllowedFileExtensions =".jpg,.png">
       </ValidationSettings> --%>

   ```

   [\UploadingFiles\UploadControl.aspx.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingFiles/UploadControl.aspx.cs):

   ```cs
   using (var stream = file.FileContent) {
   // In case additional checks are needed perform them here before saving the file
   //if (!IsValidImage(stream)) {
   //    file.IsValid = false;
   //    e.ErrorText = "Validation failed!";
   //}
   //else {
       string fileName = string.Format("{0}{1}", MapPath("~/UploadingFiles/Images/"), file.FileName);
       file.SaveAs(fileName, true);
   //}
   //}
   ```

2. Run the solution and open the **UploadingFiles/UploadControl.aspx** page.
3. Upload the **\App_Data\TestData\Malicious.aspx** file.
4. Execute the uploaded file on the server by visiting the following URL: **/UploadingFiles/Images/Malicious.aspx**

To mitigate this vulnerability, do the following:

1. Initialize the [AllowedFileExtensions](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebUploadControlValidationSettings_AllowedFileExtensionstopic) setting with a list of allowed file extensions. The server will then validate the type of the uploaded file:

```aspx
<ValidationSettings AllowedFileExtensions=".jpg, .png">
</ValidationSettings>
```

2. Disable file execution in the upload folder ([relevant StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3776847/how-to-restrict-folder-access-in-asp-net)):

```aspx
  <location path="UploadingFiles/Images">
    <system.webServer>
      <handlers>
        <clear />
        <add
          name="StaticFile"
          path="*" verb="*"
          modules="StaticFileModule"
          resourceType="Either"
          requireAccess="Read" />
      </handlers>
    </system.webServer>
  </location>
```

The default file extensions allowed by various controls that allow for file uploads:

| Control               | Allowed Extensions                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ASPxUploadControl** | _any_                                                                 |
| **ASPxBinaryImage**   | _any_                                                                 |
| **ASPxFileManager**   | _any_                                                                 |
| **ASPxHtmlEditor**    | .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .gif, .png <br> .mp3, .ogg <br> .swf <br> .mp4     |
| **ASPxRichEdit**      | .doc, .docx, .epub, .html, .htm, .mht, .mhtml, .odt, .txt, .rtf, .xml |
| **ASPxSpreadsheet**   | .xlsx, .xlsm, .xls, .xltx, .xltm, .xlt, .txt, .csv                    |

### 1.2. Prevent Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

#### 1.2.1 Prevent Uncontrolled Memory Consumption

Visit the **[UploadingFiles/UploadControlMemory.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingFiles/UploadControlMemory.aspx.cs)** page for a full code sample.

Consider the situation where the web application allows files of any size to be uploaded.

The possible security breach here occurs when a malefactor performs a denial of service ([DoS](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)) attack by uploading very large files, thereby using up server memory and disk space.

To mitigate this vulnerability:

1. Access file contents using the [FileContent](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebUploadedFile_FileContenttopic) property (a Stream) rather than the [FileBytes](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebUploadedFile_FileBytestopic) property (a byte array). This will avoid memory overflow and other issues when processing large uploaded files.

```cs
protected void uploadControl_FilesUploadComplete(object sender, DevExpress.Web.FilesUploadCompleteEventArgs e) {
    for(int i = 0; i < uploadControl.UploadedFiles.Length; i++) {
        UploadedFile file = uploadControl.UploadedFiles[i];

        // Recommended approach - use stream for large files
        using (var stream = file.FileContent) {
            DoProcessing(stream);
        }
    }
}

```

2. Specify the maximum size for uploaded files using the [UploadControlValidationSettings.MaxFileSize](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebUploadControlValidationSettings_MaxFileSizetopic) property.

> Note that in the **Advanced** uploading mode, files are loaded in small fragments (200KB by default), thus setting the **httpRuntime**>**maxRequestLength** and **requestLimits**>**maxAllowedContentLength** options in **web.config** is not sufficient to prevent attacks.

See the [Uploading Large Files](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/9822/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/File-Management/File-Upload/Concepts/Uploading-Large-Files) documentation topic for more information.

The following controls limit the maximum size for uploaded files by default:

- The **ASPxHtmlEditor** defines a 31,457,280 byte limit for uploaded file size.
- The **ASPxSpreadsheet** and **ASPxRichEdit** do not set a maximum size for an uploaded file, however there is a 31,457,280 byte limit for images to be inserted into a document. Note that both controls must be specifically enabled to allow for the uploading of files.

The File Manager control automatically allows files to be uploaded, and does not impose any limitations on the file size and extension. You can disable file uploading with this code:

```aspx
<ASPxFileManager ... >
    ...
    <SettingsUpload Enabled="false">
</ASPxFileManager>
```

Other operations on files organized by the File Manager (copy, delete, download, etc.) are configured using the [SettingsEditing](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxFileManager_SettingsEditingtopic) property. All such operations are disabled by default.

#### 1.2.2 Prevent Uncontrolled Disk Space Consumption

**Security Risks**: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)

You should always monitor the total size of files uploaded by end-users, otherwise a malefactor can perform a DoS attack by uploading too many files and using up the available disk space. The best practice is to set a limitation on the total size of uploaded files.

For example, check the upload directory's size in the [Upload Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/8298/aspnet-webforms-controls/file-management/file-upload)'s [FilesUploadComplete](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxUploadControl.FilesUploadComplete) event handler:

```cs
protected void uploadControl_FilesUploadComplete(object sender, DevExpress.Web.FilesUploadCompleteEventArgs e) {
    if(uploadControl.UploadedFiles != null && uploadControl.UploadedFiles.Length > 0) {
        for(int i = 0; i < uploadControl.UploadedFiles.Length; i++) {
            UploadedFile file = uploadControl.UploadedFiles[i];
            if(file.IsValid && file.FileName != "") {
                // Check the upload folder's size taking into account the new files.
                const long DirectoryFileSizesLimit = 10000000; // bytes
                long totalFilesSize = GetDirectoryFileSizes(MapPath("~/UploadingFiles/Images/"));
                if(file.ContentLength + totalFilesSize > DirectoryFileSizesLimit) {
                    file.IsValid = false;
                    e.ErrorText = "Total files size exceeded!";
                } else {
    ...

```

See the example project's [UploadingFiles/LimitDirectorySize.aspx.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingFiles/LimitDirectorySize.aspx.cs) file.

### 1.3. Protect Temporary Files

Visit the **[UploadingFiles/UploadControlTempFileName.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingFiles/UploadControlTempFileName.aspx.cs)** page for a full code sample.

Consider the situation where you store temporary files on the server, prior to processing them on the server (for example, to extract the data within to write to a database).

To avoid a security breach, you will need to ensure that these files are inaccessible to third parties.

To mitigate this vulnerability:

1. Store temporary files in a folder unreachable by URL (for example, _App_Data_).
2. Use a dedicated file extension for temporary files on the server (for example "\*.mytmp").
3. Consider assigning random file names using the [GetRandomFileName](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.path.getrandomfilename(v=vs.110).aspx>) method.

```cs
protected void uploadControl_FilesUploadComplete(object sender, DevExpress.Web.FilesUploadCompleteEventArgs e) {
    if (uploadControl.UploadedFiles != null && uploadControl.UploadedFiles.Length > 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i < uploadControl.UploadedFiles.Length; i++) {
            UploadedFile file = uploadControl.UploadedFiles[i];
            if (file.FileName != "") {
                string fileName = string.Format("{0}{1}", MapPath("~/UploadingFiles/Processing/"),
                    Path.GetRandomFileName() + ".tmp");
                file.SaveAs(fileName, true);
                // DoFileProcessing(fileName);
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}

```

You can also define security permissions for folders and files accessible through the File Manager control. The [Access Rules](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/119542/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/File-Management/File-Manager/Concepts/Access-Control-Overview/Access-Rules) documentation topic has further information.

## 2. Uploading and Displaying Binary Images

**Related Controls**: [ASPxBinaryImage](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/11624/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Data-Editors/Editor-Types/ASPxBinaryImage/Overview/ASPxBinaryImage-Overview), [ASPxUploadControl](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/4040/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/File-Management/File-Upload/Overview/ASPxUploadControl-Overview)

**Security Risks**: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

Consider the situation where an image is uploaded to the server. The server generates a page that contains the image, and a user opens that page in their browser.

The possible security breach is this: a malefactor creates a file containing a malicious script. This file has an image file extension. The file is added to the generated page by the server, and that page is downloaded by the user's browser. This results in the malicious script being run in the browser. Essentially this is an example of XSS (Cross-site Scripting) via content-sniffing, a particular case of [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).

To familiarize yourself with the issue:

> Note that newer versions of Google Chrome have embedded mechanisms to counteract the described security breach. Currently, you can reproduce the issue on the Mozilla Firefox browser.

1. Comment out the call of the IsValidImage method in the example project's [UploadingBinaryImage/UploadControl.aspx.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingBinaryImages/UploadControl.aspx.cs) to disable protection:
   ```cs
   // if(!IsValidImage(stream)) return;
   ```
2. In The [BinaryImageViewer.aspx.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingBinaryImages/BinaryImageViewer.aspx.cs) file, uncomment the `Response.ContentType = "image"` line and comment out the `Response.ContentType = "image/jpeg"` line.
3. Run the example solution and open the **[UploadingBinaryImage/UploadControl.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingBinaryImages/UploadControl.aspx)** page.
4. Upload the **[\App_Data\TestData\Content-Sniffing-XSS.jpg](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/App_Data/TestData/Content-Sniffing-XSS.jpg)** file. This is nominally a JPEG image, but in fact is a JavaScript file that emulates a malicious script.
5. Open the **[UploadingBinaryImage/BinaryImageViewer.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingBinaryImages/BinaryImageViewer.aspx)** page. As with every ASPX request, the markup is generated by the server on request, and the uploaded file will be added to the [code behind](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingBinaryImages/BinaryImageViewer.aspx.cs).
6. The JavaScript code from the uploaded file is executed by the browser:

![malicious-image](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/uploading-binary-image-1.png?raw=true)

To mitigate this vulnerability:

1. Programmatically check whether the uploaded file is really an image before saving it to any server-side storage (see the [IsValidImage](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/fd40850d01330a3d16f1a5a8c3cfd80cbe831c60/SecurityBestPractices/UploadingBinaryImages/UploadControl.aspx.cs#L22-L31) method implementation).

```cs
protected void ASPxUploadControl1_FileUploadComplete(object sender,
  DevExpress.Web.FileUploadCompleteEventArgs e) {
    // Here contentBytes should be saved to a database
    using(var stream = e.UploadedFile.FileContent) {
        if(!IsValidImage(stream)) return;

        // For demonstration purposes, content is saved to a file
        string fileName = Server.MapPath("~/App_Data/TestData/avatar.jpg");
        e.UploadedFile.SaveAs(fileName, true);
    }
}

static bool IsValidImage(Stream stream) {
    try {
        using(var image = Image.FromStream(stream)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    catch(Exception) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

2. Use the [ASPxBinaryImage](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/11624/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Data-Editors/Editor-Types/ASPxBinaryImage/Overview/ASPxBinaryImage-Overview) control for uploading images. This control automatically implements an image file type check.

\[Aspx\]

```aspx
<dx:ASPxBinaryImage ID="ASPxBinaryImage1" runat="server">
    <EditingSettings Enabled="True">
    </EditingSettings>
</dx:ASPxBinaryImage>
<dx:ASPxButton ID="ASPxButton1" runat="server" OnClick="ASPxButton1_Click" Text="Save">
</dx:ASPxButton>
```

\[C#\]

```cs
protected void ASPxButton1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    byte[] contentBytes = ASPxBinaryImage1.ContentBytes;
    // Here contentBytes should be saved to a database

    // For demonstration purposes, content is saved to a file
    string fileName = Server.MapPath("~/App_Data/UploadedData/avatar.jpg");
    File.WriteAllBytes(fileName, contentBytes);
}

```

Another strong recommendation is to _always_ specify the exact content type when you add binary data to the response:

**Correct:** `Response.ContentType = "image/jpeg"`;

**Potential security breach:** `Response.ContentType = "image"`.

Additionally, it is a good practice to add the `X-CONTENT-TYPE-OPTIONS="nosniff"` response header:

```cs
protected void ASPxButton1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    Response.Headers.Add("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
}
```

### Notes:

1. Microsoft Edge automatically detects a file's type based on its content, which prevents the execution of malicious scripts as described here.
2. Make sure to specify the maximum uploaded file size to prevent those DoS attacks based on uploading large files.

---

## 3. Authorization

This section provides information on using DevExpress controls in web applications that implement authorization and access control. The following features are considered:

- [3.1. Reporting](#31-reporting)
- [3.2. Dashboard](#32-dashboard)
- [3.3. Query Builder](#33-query-builder)

### 3.1. Reporting

To implement authorization logic for the Document Viewer, provide a custom report storage derived from the [ReportStorageWebExtension](http://help.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsWebExtensionsReportStorageWebExtensiontopic) class. As a starting point, you can copy the reference implementation of such a storage class from the example project's [ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs) file to your application and fine-tune it for your needs. The following customizations would have to be considered:

#### A. Viewing Reports

In the sample project, the [GetViewableReportDisplayNamesForCurrentUser](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L25-L38) method returns a list of reports that can be viewed by the currently logged-in user:

```cs
// Logic for getting reports available for viewing
public static IEnumerable<string> GetViewableReportDisplayNamesForCurrentUser() {
    var identityName = GetIdentityName();

    var result = new List<string> { reports[typeof(PublicReport)] }; // For unauthenticated users (i.e., public)

    if (identityName == "Admin") {
        result.AddRange(new[] { reports[typeof(AdminReport)], reports[typeof(JohnReport)] });
    } else if (identityName == "John") {
        result.Add(reports[typeof(JohnReport)]);
    }
    return result;
}
```

This method is then called from the overridden [GetData](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L60-L70) method and other methods that need to interact with the report storage:

```cs
public override byte[] GetData(string url) {
    var reportNames = GetViewableReportDisplayNamesForCurrentUser();
    if (!reportNames.Contains(url))
        throw new UnauthorizedAccessException();

    XtraReport publicReport = CreateReportByDisplayName(url);
    using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream()) {
        publicReport.SaveLayoutToXml(ms);
        return ms.GetBuffer();
    }
}
```

#### B. Editing Reports

In the sample project, the [GetEditableReportNamesForCurrentUser](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L41-L53) method returns a list of reports that can be edited by the currently logged-in user:

```cs
// Logic for getting reports available for editing
public static IEnumerable<string> GetEditableReportNamesForCurrentUser() {
    var identityName = GetIdentityName();
    if (identityName == "Admin") {
        return new[] { reports[typeof(AdminReport)], reports[typeof(JohnReport)] };
    }
    if (identityName == "John") {
        return new[] { reports[typeof(JohnReport)] };
    }

    return Array.Empty<string>();
}
```

This method is then called from the overridden [IsValidUrl](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L80-L83) method and other methods that need to write report data.

```cs
public override bool IsValidUrl(string url) {
    var reportNames = GetEditableReportNamesForCurrentUser();
    return reportNames.Contains(url);
}
```

To prevent errors in the browser when handling unauthorized access attempts, check the access rights on the page's [PageLoad](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportDesignerPage.aspx.cs#L6-L13) event. If the user is not authorized to open the report, redirect them to a public page.

```cs
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    var name = Request.QueryString["name"];
    var reportNames = ReportStorageWithAccessRules.GetEditableReportNamesForCurrentUser();
    if(reportNames.Contains(name))
        ASPxReportDesigner1.OpenReport(name);
    else
        Response.Redirect("~/Authorization/Reports/ReportViewerPage.aspx");
}
```

#### Register the Custom Report Storage

After implementing your custom report storage with the required access rules, you must register it in the [Global.asax.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Global.asax.cs) file:

```cs
DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.Extensions.ReportStorageWebExtension.RegisterExtensionGlobal(new ReportStorageWithAccessRules());
```

#### Make Sure that Authentication Rules are Applied

In the example project, you can check whether the customization has had any effect by using the following steps:

- Open the [PublicReportPage.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/PublicPages/PublicReportPage.aspx) page without logging in. This page contains a Report Viewer.
- Try to open a report using the client API in the browser console. The example report has restricted access:

```
>documentViewer.OpenReport("Admin Report");
```

The browser console will respond with the following error.

![console-output](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/authoriazation-reports-accessdenied.png?raw=true)

#### Provide an Operation Logger

The Web Document Viewer control maintains communication with the server side to obtain any additional document data when it is required, for example when a user switches pages or exports the document. Because of this feature, a user could navigate through a given report's pages even after having been logged out.

The possible security breach here occurs when a malefactor can forge a request that emulates page switching in order to get access to any protected information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, implement a custom Operation Logger in order to enforce fine-grained control over which operations are available to a user. Extend the [WebDocumentViewerOperationLogger](http://help.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsWebWebDocumentViewerWebDocumentViewerOperationLoggertopic) class and override this class's methods to implement the required access control rules (see the [OperationLogger.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/OperationLogger.cs) file of the example project).

Register the operation logger in [Global.asax.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/586084eda743711618c8d3e01d52736aac70a8c8/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Global.asax.cs#L25):

```cs
DefaultWebDocumentViewerContainer.Register<WebDocumentViewerOperationLogger, OperationLogger>();
```

> Note that in order to simplify the example project the logger implementation obtains the required user account data from a static property. This is not a recommended solution: such an implementation could have difficulties running in a cloud environment or on a web farm. Instead, we recommend that you store authentication information in some appropriate data storage.

To familiarize yourself with the solution:

1. Run the example application, log in using the [/Login.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Login.aspx) page.
2. Open the report preview ([/Authorization/Reports/ReportViewerPage.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportViewerPage.aspx)) in a separate browser tab.
3. Log out.
4. Try switching report pages.

The following error will be signaled:

![Operation Logger Error](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/authorization-reportopertaionlogger.png?raw=true)

#### Restrict Access to Data Connections and Data Tables

The [Report Designer](https://documentation.devexpress.com/XtraReports/17103/Creating-End-User-Reporting-Applications/Web-Reporting/Report-Designer) control allows a user to browse available data connection and data tables using the integrated [Query Builder](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/114930/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Query-Builder). Refer to the [Query Builder](#33-query-builder) subsection in this document to learn how to restrict access to this information, based on authorization rules.

### 3.2. Dashboard

The [DevExpress Web Dashboard](https://devexpress.github.io/dotnet-eud/dashboard-for-web/articles/index.html) can operate in one of two supported modes:

**1) Callbacks are processed by the ASPx page**

The ASPx page contains the ASPxDashboard control and the [UseDashboardConfigurator](http://help.devexpress.com/#Dashboard/DevExpressDashboardWebASPxDashboard_UseDashboardConfiguratortopic) property is set to false. This is the default mode for the dashboard, and you can use the standard ASP.NET access restriction mechanisms:

```aspx
<location path="Authorization/Dashboards">
    <system.web>
        <authorization>
           <deny users="?" />
        </authorization>
    </system.web>
</location>
```

**2) Callbacks are processed by the Dashboard Configurator**

Here the callbacks are processed by the DevExpress HTTP handler, and the [UseDashboardConfigurator](http://help.devexpress.com/#Dashboard/DevExpressDashboardWebASPxDashboard_UseDashboardConfiguratortopic) property is set to true.

This is the recommended mode as it is considerably faster and much more flexible. In this mode though, any access restriction rules defined using the default mechanisms have no effect. Instead, the access control should be performed by a custom dashboard storage class that implements the [IEditableDashboardStorage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.IEditableDashboardStorage?tabs=tabid-csharp%2Ctabid-T392813_7_52373613) interface.

As a starting point, you can copy the reference implementation of such a storage class from the example project's [DashboardStorageWithAccessRules.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Dashboards/DashboardStorageWithAccessRules.cs) file to your application and fine-tune it for your needs.

The [DashboardStorageWithAccessRules](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Dashboards/DashboardStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L12-L126) class implementation defines the access restrictions:

```cs
// Register dashboard layouts
var adminId = AddDashboardCore(XDocument.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(@"/App_Data/AdminDashboard.xml")), "Admin Dashboard");
var johnId = AddDashboardCore(XDocument.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(@"/App_Data/JohnDashboard.xml")), "John Dashboard");
this.publicDashboardId = AddDashboardCore(XDocument.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(publicDashboardPath)), "Public Dashboard");
```

The following code defines which user should have access to which dashboards:

```cs
// Authorization logic
authDictionary.Add("Admin", new HashSet<string>(new [] { adminId, johnId, publicDashboardId })); // Admin can view/edit all dashboards.
authDictionary.Add("John", new HashSet<string>(new[] { johnId })); // John can view/edit only his dashboard.

public bool IsAuthorized(string dashboardId) {
    var identityName = GetIdentityName();
    if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(identityName)) {
        return authDictionary.ContainsKey(identityName) && authDictionary[identityName].Contains(dashboardId);
    }

    return false;
}

static string GetIdentityName() {
    return HttpContext.Current.User?.Identity?.Name;
}
```

Register the custom dashboard storage class in the [Global.asax.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Global.asax.cs) file as shown below.

```cs
DashboardConfigurator.Default.SetDashboardStorage(new DashboardStorageWithAccessRules());
DashboardConfigurator.Default.CustomParameters += (o, args) => {
if (!new DashboardStorageWithAccessRules().IsAuthorized(args.DashboardId))
    throw new UnauthorizedAccessException();
};
```

With this custom implementation of a dashboard storage, if a user named 'John' tries to use the client API to open a report with restricted access (e.g., a report with id='1'), the handler will return error 404, File Not Found:

```js
dashboard.LoadDashboard("1"); // Load a dashboard available only to Admin.
```

```
GET http://localhost:65252/Authorization/Dashboards/DXDD.axd?action=DashboardAction/1&_=1525787741461 404 (Not Found)
```

![console-output](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/authorization-dashboard-404.png?raw=true)

#### Restrict Access to Data Connections and Data Tables

The Web Dashboard control allows a user to browse available data connection and data tables using the integrated [Query Builder](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/114930/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Query-Builder). Refer to the [Query Builder](#33-query-builder) subsection in this document to learn how to restrict access to this information based on authorization rules.

### 3.3. Query Builder

The standalone [Query Builder](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/114930/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Query-Builder) as well as the Query Builder integrated into the Report and Dashboard designers allows an end-user to browse a web application's data connections and the data tables available through those connections. In a web application that uses access control, you will to write code to restrict a user's access to the available connections and data tables.

To restrict access to connection strings, implement a custom connection string provider:

```cs
public class DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider : IDataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider {

    public Dictionary<string, string> GetConnectionDescriptions() {
        Dictionary<string, string> connections =
            new Dictionary<string, string> { { "nwindConnection", "NWind database" } };

        // Customize the loaded connections list.

        // Access restriction logic.
        //if(GetIdentityName() == "Admin")
        //    connections.Add("secretConnection", "Admin only database");

        return connections;
    }

    public DataConnectionParametersBase GetDataConnectionParameters(string name) {
        return AppConfigHelper.LoadConnectionParameters(name);
    }
}
```

To restrict access to data tables, implement a custom database schema provider:

```cs
public class DBSchemaProviderEx : IDBSchemaProviderEx {
    public DBTable[] GetTables(SqlDataConnection connection, params string[] tableList) {
        // Check permissions.

        var dbTables = connection.GetDBSchema().Tables;
        return dbTables.Where(t => t.Name == "Categories" || t.Name == "Products").ToArray();
    }

    public DBTable[] GetViews(SqlDataConnection connection, params string[] viewList) {
        return Array.Empty<DBTable>();
    }

    public DBStoredProcedure[] GetProcedures(SqlDataConnection connection, params string[] procedureList) {
        return Array.Empty<DBStoredProcedure>();
    }

    public void LoadColumns(SqlDataConnection connection, params DBTable[] tables) {
    }
}
```

The Dashboard Designer requires the database schema provider to be created by a factory object:

```cs
public class DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory : DevExpress.DataAccess.Web.IDataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory {
    public IDBSchemaProviderEx Create() {
        return new DBSchemaProviderEx();
    }
}
```

As a starting point, you can copy the reference implementation from the example project's [DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider.cs) and [DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory.cs) files to your application and fine-tune it for your needs.

Register the implemented classes for the Report Designer, Dashboard Designer, or standalone Query Builder in the [Global.asax.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Global.asax.cs) file, as shown here:

**Report Designer:**

```cs
DefaultReportDesignerContainer.RegisterDataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider<DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider>();
DefaultReportDesignerContainer.RegisterDataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory<DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory>();
```

**Dashboard Designer:**

```cs
DashboardConfigurator.Default.SetConnectionStringsProvider(new DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider());
DashboardConfigurator.Default.SetDBSchemaProvider(new DBSchemaProviderEx());

```

**Query Builder:**

```cs
DefaultQueryBuilderContainer.Register<IDataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider, DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider>();
DefaultQueryBuilderContainer.RegisterDataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory<DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory>();
```

## 4. Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Related Controls**: Controls with data editing available by default (e.g., [ASPxGridView](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxGridViewtopic), [ASPxCardView](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxCardViewtopic), [ASPxVerticalGrid](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxVerticalGridtopic), [ASPxTreeList](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxTreeListASPxTreeListtopic), etc.)

**Security Risks**: [CWE-352](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

This section provides information on how to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks on your web application. The vulnerability affects applications performing POST requests including those using DevExpress AJAX-enabled controls such as the Grid View. Although there are authorization mechanisms that allow you to deny access by Insecure Direct Object References (for example: _example.com/app/SecureReport.aspx?id=1_), they do not protect you from CSRF attacks.

The possible security breach could occur as follows:

1. A malefactor implements a phishing page.
2. A user inadvertently visits this phishing page, which then sends a malicious request to your web application using the user's cookies.
3. As a result, the malicious action is performed on the user's behalf, allowing the malefactor to access or modify the user's data or account info.

For more information on the vulnerability, refer to the [CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html) article.

To mitigate the vulnerability, use the **AntiForgeryToken** pattern. Refer to the [AntiForgery.Validate](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg548011(v=vs.111).aspx>) MSDN article to learn more.

The best practice to prevent CSRF is to create a [MasterPage](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UsingAntiForgeryToken/MasterPageWithAntiForgeryToken.Master#L13) that:

1. Generates an AntiForgery token, and
2. Checks this token within the Pre_Load event.

```xml
<form id="form1" runat="server">
    <%= System.Web.Helpers.AntiForgery.GetHtml() %>
```

On the client, generate a token and a cookie signed with a machine key:

```html
<input
  name="__RequestVerificationToken"
  type="hidden"
  value="SKZi1uvLbg_G1P-KoK2AJdmeorX1fBgdCbVhLUDim9sk6AFwReVEY6XsuPrvsXJLq5MWOVaGXMnpx09srXkLM_Yjtcfg_4tpc1747jOgo941"
/>
```

On the server, check the cookie and token in the [Validate method](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UsingAntiForgeryToken/MasterPageWithAntiForgeryToken.Master.cs#L6-L13):

```cs
protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e) {
    base.OnInit(e);
    Page.PreLoad += OnPreLoad;
}
protected void OnPreLoad(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    if (IsPostBack)
        System.Web.Helpers.AntiForgery.Validate();
}
```

If the validation fails, the MasterPage will generate an error:

![AntiForgeryError](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/anti-forgery-error.png?raw=true)

The sample project illustrates how to ensure your web application's security in two use-case scenarios:

### Preventing Unauthorized CRUD Operations

In this scenario, an attack attempts to perform a CRUD operation on the server side by emulating a request from a data aware control (an [ASPxGridView](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxGridViewtopic) in the example).

![AntiForgeryGrid](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/anti-forgery-grid.png?raw=true)

See the example project's [UsingAntiForgeryToken/EditForm.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UsingAntiForgeryToken/EditForm.aspx) file to familiarize yourself with the vulnerability.

### Preventing Unauthorized Changes to User Account Information

In this scenario, an attack attempts to modify the user account information (the email address in the example).

![AntiForgeryEmail](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/anti-forgery-email.png?raw=true)

See the example project's [UsingAntiForgeryToken/EditForm.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/UsingAntiForgeryToken/EditForm.aspx) file to familiarize yourself with the vulnerability.

**See Also:** [Stack Overflow - preventing cross-site request forgery (csrf) attacks in asp.net web forms](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29939566/preventing-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-attacks-in-asp-net-web-forms)

---

## 5. Preventing Sensitive Information Exposure

**Security Risks**: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)

This section describes security vulnerabilities that can make some sensitive information available to untrusted parties.

### 5.1 Information Exposure Through Error Messages

The possible security breach can occur when the server generates an exception. If an application is configured incorrectly, a detailed information on the error is displayed to an end-user. This information can include sensitive parts giving a malefactor an insight on the application's infrastructure, file names and so on.

This behavior is controlled by the [customErrors](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/h0hfz6fc(v=vs.100)>) web.config option. This option accepts the following values:

- `RemoteOnly` (default) - In this mode, detailed errors are displayed only for connections from the local machine.
- `On` - Ensures that private messages are never displayed.
- `Off` - Forces private messages for all connections.

The following image demonstrates an error message exposing sensitive information:

![Unsafe Error Message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/wiki-static-resources/error-message-exposed.png)

In the secure configuration, the error message will be substituted by a more generic one:

![Safe Error Message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/wiki-static-resources/error-message-generic.png)

#### Manually Displaying Error Messages

It is recommended that you never show exception messages (Exception.Message) in your application's UI because this text can contain sensitive information. For example, the following code sample demonstrates an unsafe approach:

```cs
protected void UpdateButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    try {
        // DoSomething()
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Some sensitive information");
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        UpdateStatusLabel.Visible = true;
        UpdateStatusLabel.Text = ex.Message;
    }
}
```

Consider displaying custom error messages if you want to inform end-users about occurred errors:

```cs
protected void UpdateButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    try {
        // DoSomething()
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Some sensitive information");
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        if(ex is InvalidOperationException)
            UpdateStatusLabel.Text = "Some error occured...";
        else
            UpdateStatusLabel.Text = "General error occured...";
    }
}
```

Refer to the example project's [InformationExposure/ErrorMessage.aspx.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/InformationExposure/ErrorMessage.aspx.cs#L8) file to familiarize yourself with the issue.

### 5.2 Availability of Invisible Column Values Through the Client-Side API

#### Prevent Access to Hidden Column Data

This vulnerability is associated with grid-based controls. Consider a situation, in which a control has a hidden column bound to some sensitive data that is not displayed to an end-user and is only used on the server. A malefactor can still request a value of such column using the control's client API:

```js
gridView.GetRowValues(0, "UnitPrice", function (Value) {
  alert(Value);
});
```

See the example project's [ClientSideApi/GridView.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/ClientSideApi/GridView.aspx#L46-L48) page.

The image below demonstrates how a hidden column's value can be accessed using a browser's console:

![Unprotected Column Values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/wiki-static-resources/access-hidden-columns-no-protection.png)

Set the **AllowReadUnexposedColumnsFromClientApi** property to false to disable this behavior:

```cs
AllowReadUnexposedColumnsFromClientApi = "False";
```

#### Prevent Access by Field Name

Another vulnerability can occur when a malefactor tries to get a row value for a data field for which there is no column in the control:

```js
gridView.GetRowValues(0, "GuidField", function (Value) {
  alert(Value);
});
```

The capability to do so is controlled by the **AllowReadUnlistedFieldsFromClientApi** property and is disabled by default (safe configuration):

![Protected Column Values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/wiki-static-resources/access-hidden-columns-use-protection.png)

When it comes to protecting a grid control's data source data, a general recommendation to perform separate queries for data sources whose data is displayed in UI. These queries should never request data that should be kept in secret.

### 5.3 Information Exposure Through Source Code

**Security Risks**: [CWE-540](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/540.html), [CWE-615](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/615.html)

The DevExpress default HTTP handler (DXR.axd) serves static files including images, scripts and styles. We assume that these static files are intended for public access and do not expose any sensitive information or server-side code. However there are additional recommendation for writing custom scripts and styles:

- Do not hardcode any credentials in scripts.
- Consider obfuscating these files in the following cases:
  - The file contains code that should be protected as an intellectual property.
  - The file's content can give a malefactor an idea about the backend system's architecture and possible vulnerabilities.

For example, consider the following code:

```js
function GetSystemState() {
...
}
```

The minified version gives considerably less information about the backend structure:

```js
function s1(){...}
```

---

## 6. Preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks with Encoding

**Security Risks**: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html), [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

The vulnerability occurs when a web page is rendered using a content specified by an end user. If user input is not properly sanitized, a resulting page can be injected with a malicious script.

It is strongly suggested that you always sanitize page contents that can be specified by a user. You should be aware of what kind of sanitization you use so it is both compatible with the displayed content and provides the intended level of safety.
For example, you can remove HTML tags throughout the content but it can corrupt text that is intended to contain code samples. A more generic approach would be to substitute all '<', '>' and '&' symbols with `&lt;`, `&gt;` and `&amp;` character codes.

Microsoft provides the standard [HttpUtility](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dotnet/api/system.web.httputility.htmlencode?view=netframework-4.7.2) class that you can use to encode data in various use-case scenarios. It provides the following methods:

| Method              | Usage                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| HtmlEncode          | Sanitizes an untrusted input inserted into an HTML output |
| HtmlAttributeEncode | Sanitizes an untrusted input assigned to a tag attribute  |
| JavaScriptEncode    | Sanitizes an untrusted input used within a script         |
| UrlEncode           | Sanitizes an untrusted input used to generate a URL       |

To safely insert user input value into markup, wrap it with the `HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` method call:

```cs
SearchResultLiteral.Text =
  string.Format("Your search - {0} - did not match any documents.", HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(SearchBox.Text));
```

See the example project's [HtmlEncoding/General.aspx.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/HtmlEncoding/General.aspx.cs) file.

To insert user input into a JavaScript block, you need to prepare the string using the `HttpUtility.JavaScriptStringEncode`:

```html
<script>
  var s = "<%= HttpUtility.JavaScriptStringEncode(SearchBox.Text) %>";
  // DoSomething(s);
</script>
```

Input text containing unsafe symbols will be converted to a safe form. In this example, if a user specifies the following unsafe string...

```
"<b>'test'</b>
```

... the script will be rendered as shown below:

```js
var s = "\"\u003cb\u003e'test'\u003c/b\u003e";
```

See the example project's [HtmlEncoding/General.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/HtmlEncoding/General.aspx#L21-L22) file.

### 6.1 Encoding in DevExpress Controls

By default, DevExpress controls encode displayed values that can be obtained from a data source. Refer to the [HTML-Encoding](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/117902/Common-Concepts/HTML-Encoding) document for more information.

This behavior is specified by a control's EncodeHtml property. If a control displays a value that can be modified by an untrusted party, we recommend that you never disable this setting or sanitize the displayed content manually.

To get familiar with the vulnerability, open the example project's EncodeHtml.aspx page and uncomment the following line in the [code behind](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/HtmlEncoding/EncodeHtml.aspx.cs):

```cs
((GridViewDataTextColumn)GridView.Columns["ProductName"]).PropertiesEdit.EncodeHtml = false;
```

Launch the project and open the page in the browser. A data field's content will be interpreted as a script and you well see an alert popup.

![Devexpress Controls - No Encoding](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/grid-columns-no-encoding.png?raw=true)

In the safe configuration, the field's content would be interpreted as text and correctly displayed:

![Devexpress Controls - Use Encoding](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/grid-columns-use-encoding.png?raw=true)

#### 6.1.1 Encoding Header Filter Items

**Related Controls**: [ASPxGridView](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/5823/aspnet-webforms-controls/grid-view), [ASPxCardView](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/114048/aspnet-webforms-controls/card-view), [ASPxVerticalGrid](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/116045/aspnet-webforms-controls/vertical-grid), [ASPxTreeList](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/7928/aspnet-webforms-controls/tree-list)

You should always encode (wrap with the HttpUtility.HtmlEncode method call) filter items that are obtained from an unsafe data source or specified by an end user.

```cs
ASPxGridViewHeaderFilterEventArgs e) {
    if(e.Column.FieldName == "ProductName") {
        e.Values.Clear();
        // Adding custom values from an unsafe data source

        // Safe approach - Display Text is encoded
        e.AddValue(HttpUtility.HtmlEncode("<b>T</b>est <img src=1 onerror=alert('XSS') />"), "1");

        // Unsafe approach - Display Text is not encoded
        //e.AddValue("<b>T</b>est <img src=1 onerror=alert('XSS') />", "1");
    }
}
```

See the example project's [HtmlEncoding/EncodeHtml.aspx.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/HtmlEncoding/EncodeHtml.aspx.cs#L18) file.

If filter items are not encoded, an XSS can be performed when a user opens a header filter dropdown:

![Templates - Unsanitized Content](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/header-filter-item-encoding.png?raw=true)

### 6.2 Encoding in Templates

If you inject data field values in templates, we recommend that you always [encode the data field values](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/HtmlEncoding/Templates.aspx#L17):

```xml
<asp:Label ID="ProductNameLabel" runat="server"
   Text='<%# System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(Eval("ProductName")) %>' />
```

Inserting unsanitized content can open your application for XSS attacks:

![Templates - Unsanitized Content](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/templates-no-encoding.png?raw=true)

With encoding, the content would be interpreted as text and correctly displayed:

![Templates - Sanitized Content](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/templates-use-encoding.png?raw=true)

By default, DevExpress controls wrap templated contents with a `HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` method call.

### 6.3 Encoding Callback Data

When a client displays data received from the server via a callback, a security breach can take place if this data has not been properly encoded. For example, in the [code below](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/HtmlEncoding/Callback.aspx#L14-L19), such content is assigned to an element's `innerHTML`:

```xml
<dx:ASPxCallback runat="server" ID="CallbackControl" OnCallback="Callback_Callback" ClientInstanceName="callbackControl" >
    <ClientSideEvents CallbackComplete="function(s, e) {
        document.getElementById('namePlaceHodler').innerHTML = e.result;
            if(callbackControl.cpSomeInfo)
                document.getElementById('someInfo').innerHTML = callbackControl.cpSomeInfo;
        }" />
</dx:ASPxCallback>
```

The safe approach is to use `HtmlEncode` in the [server-side code](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/HtmlEncoding/Callback.aspx.cs#L14):

```cs
protected void Callback_Callback(object source, DevExpress.Web.CallbackEventArgs e) {
    // Not secure
    // e.Result = "<img src=1 onerror=alert('XSS') /> ";
    // CallbackControl.JSProperties["cpSomeInfo"] = "<video src=1 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>";

    e.Result = HttpUtility.HtmlEncode("<img src=1 onerror=alert('XSS') /> ");
    CallbackControl.JSProperties["cpSomeInfo"] = HttpUtility.HtmlEncode("<video src=1 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>");
}
```

### 6.4 Encoding Page Title

When you assign a value from a database or user input to the page title, you need to make sure that the value is properly encoded to prevent possible script injections.

For example, the [code below](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/HtmlEncoding/EncodePageTitle.aspx.cs#L13) assigns a value from a database to the page title.

```cs
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    var ds = SqlDataSource1.Select(new System.Web.UI.DataSourceSelectArguments()) as DataView;
    var value = ds[0]["ProductName"]; // value from DB = "</title><script>alert('XSS')</script>";

    //Title = "Product: " + value.ToString(); // Not secure
    Title = "Product: " + HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(value).ToString(); // Secure
}

```

If encoding was not used, the resulting markup would contain a malicious script:

```html
<head><title>
    Product: </title><script>alert('XSS')</script>
</title></head>
```

With encoding, the markup is rendered as follows:

```html
<head>
  <title>
    Product: &lt;/title&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;XSS&#39;)&lt;/script&gt;
  </title>
</head>
```

### 6.5 Dangerous Links

It is potentially dangerous to use render a hyperlink's HREF attribute using a value from a database or user input.

DevExpress grid based controls remove all potentially dangerous contents (for example, "javascript:") from HREF values when rendering hyperlink columns:

![Unsafe Link](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/url-no-encoding.png?raw=true)

This behavior is controlled by a column's `RemovePotentiallyDangerousNavigateUrl` option (true by default):

```xml
<dx:GridViewDataHyperLinkColumn FieldName="Description" VisibleIndex="1">
   <PropertiesHyperLinkEdit RemovePotentiallyDangerousNavigateUrl="True” />
</dx:GridViewDataHyperLinkColumn>
```

We recommend that you never set this option to `false` if the URL value in the database can be modified by untrusted parties.

See the example project's [HtmlEncoding/DangerousNavigateUrl.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/HtmlEncoding/DangerousNavigateUrl.aspx#L20) page.

## 7. User Input Validation

**Security Risks**: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

### 7.1 General Recommendations

It is strongly recommended that you validate values obtained from an end user before you save them to a database or use in any other way. The values should be validated on several levels:

1. Specify the required restrictions for inputs on the client.

2. Validate submitted values on the server before saving.

3. Specifies the required data integrity conditions on the database level.

4. Validate the values in the code that directly uses them.

> Note that client validation is only server load optimization. To ensure safety, always use client validation in conjunction with server validation.

![Validation Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/wiki-static-resources/validation-diagram.png)

You can specify value restrictions using a control's properties such as MaxLength, Min/Max Values, Required, etc. Server side validation does not allow to submit an invalid value even if you manage to send an invalid value bypassing the client validation. If the value is invalid, the editor's value is set to the previous value set on the editor's `init`.

> Note that starting with the version 19.2, the value set on `init` is also validated and cannot be saved if validation fails. In earlier versions, this value would be saved without validation if it was not modified on the client.

The image below demonstrates how validation errors are indicated by DevExpress controls:

![Validation Errors](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/webforms-input-validation.png?raw=true)

See the example project's [ValidateInput/General.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/ValidateInput/General.aspx) file.

### 7.2 Built-in Validation in DevExpress Controls

Some DevExpress web controls provide in-built validation mechanisms that apply restrictions to input values when certain settings are specified. The table below lists controls that have in-built validation along with properties that control the validation logic.

| Control                                                                                                     | Validation-Related Properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### 7.3 Validation in List Editors

List controls in the DevExpress ASP.NET suite provide the `DataSecurity` property that specifies how a control handles input values that do not exist in the list. By default, this property is set to `Default`. With this setting, an editor accepts values that aren't in the list. Set the `DataSecurity` property to `Strict` to prohibit such values.

If you use the Strict DataSecurity mode, ViewState is disabled and you use perform data binding in runtime, you should perform data binding on Page_Init. Binding on Page_load is too late because an editor's validation triggers earlier then its items are populated.

See the example project's [ValidateInput/ListEditors.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/ValidateInput/ListEditors.aspx#L8) page.

### 7.4 Disable ASP.NET Inbuilt Request Validation

ASP.NET checks input values for potentially dangerous content. For example, if an end-user types `<b>` into a text input and submits the form, they will be redirected to an error page with the following message:

```
System.Web.HttpRequestValidationException: A potentially dangerous Request value was detected from the client (Property="<b>")
```

In many cases such checks can have undesired side effects:

- An end user cannot enter text containing elements that are common in technical texts, for example "Use the &lt;b&gt; tag to make text bold".

- On a validation error, ASP.NET raises an exception and responds with the default error page. Because of this, you cannot handle the error and display a user-friendly error message.

Because of these reasons, the inbuilt request value checks are commonly disabled. You can do this using the `validateRequest` setting available in the `/system.web/pages` section of [web.config](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Web.config#L23-L24):

```xml
<system.web>
  <httpRuntime requestValidationMode="2.0" />
  <pages validateRequest="false">
```

> Regardless or whether or not request checks are enabled, you should use encoding to protect your application from XSS attacks. Refer to the [section 6](#6-preventing-cross-site-scripting-xss-attacks-with-encoding) of this document to learn more.

### 7.5 Inlining SVG Images

SVG markup can contain scripts that will be executed if this SVG is inlined into a page. For example, the code below executes a script embedded into SVG markup:

##### [APSX file](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/ValidateInput/SvgInline.aspx):

```aspx
<asp:Content ID="Content2" ContentPlaceHolderID="ContentPlaceHolder1" runat="server">
    <p>Inline Svg images are not secure! You must trust the source!</p>
    <p>For example: Svg bytes uploaded by end user, stored in the data source and embedded inline. JavaScript is excecuted:</p>
    <div id="svgInlineImageContainer" runat="server"></div>
</asp:Content>
```

##### [Code-behind](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/ValidateInput/SvgInline.aspx.cs):

```cs
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    // Init Value from DataSource
    var svgImageWithJavaScriptCode = "<svg height=100 width=100><circle cx=50 cy=50 r=40 stroke=black stroke-width=2 fill=red /><script>alert('XXS')</script></svg>";
    svgInlineImageContainer.InnerHtml = svgImageWithJavaScriptCode;
}
```

## 8. Export to CSV

**Security Risks**: [CWE-74](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html)

Control data exported to CSV can include content that spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel interprets as formula. Such formulas can potentially execute shell commands. For example the following formula runs the Windows Calculator when evaluated:

```
=cmd|' /C calc'!'!A1'
```

This may cause a security issue if an end-user opens the exported file in a spreadsheet program and allows the program to run executable content. Microsoft Excel displays a message explicitly asking a user whether or not to run executable content.

To prevent possible security issues, set the `EncodeCsvExecutableContent` property to true. In this mode, the exported content is encoded so it cannot be interpreted as executable.

This behavior is controlled by the following properties:

- At the control level - `DevExpress.XtraPrinting.CsvExportOptions.EncodeExecutableContent`:

  ```cs
  // General Approach
  protected void Button_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    var options = new CsvExportOptionsEx();
    options.EncodeExecutableContent = DefaultBoolean.True;
    ASPxGridView1.ExportCsvToResponse(options);
  }

  // For a Toolbar Button
  protected void ASPxGridView1_BeforeExport(object sender, DevExpress.Web.ASPxGridBeforeExportEventArgs e) {
    (e.ExportOptions as CsvExportOptionsEx).EncodeExecutableContent = DefaultBoolean.True;
  }
  ```

- At the application level (a Global.asax setting) - `DevExpress.Export.ExportSettings.EncodeCsvExecutableContent`:

  ```cs
  DevExpress.Export.ExportSettings.EncodeCsvExecutableContent = DevExpress.Utils.DefaultBoolean.True;
  ```

This setting is not enabled by default because escaped content (everything that starts with "=", "-", "+", "@", "") in CSV can be unacceptable in many use-case scenarios. For example, escaping will brake text values that happed to start with "=" or negative numbers. For example:

```
Product Name,Quantity Per Unit,Unit Price,Units In Stock, Status
"""=Chai""",10 boxes x 20 bags,$18.00,39,$702.00, """-10%"""
Chang,24 - 12 oz bottles,$19.00,17,$323.00, 5%
```

Because Excel requires a user's permission to run executable content, we do not enable this setting by default and allow a user to enable this settings if it suites the use case.

See the following article to learn more about CSV injections: [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSV_Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSV_Injection)

## 9. Unauthorized Server Operation via Client-Sided API

**Security Risks**: [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html), [CWE-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)

### 9.1. Unauthorized CRUD Operations in the View Mode

See the example project's [ClientSideApi/GridView.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/ClientSideApi/GridView.aspx) page.

Grid-based controls (ASPxGridView, ASPxCardView, etc.) expose client methods that trigger CRUD operations on the server. For example, you can call the [ASPxClientGridView.DeleteRow](<https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/js-ASPxClientGridView.DeleteRow(visibleIndex)>) method on the client to delete a grid row. If a control is configured incorrectly, these methods can be used to alter data even if the control is intended to display data in view-only mode (the data editting UI is hidden).

To familiarize yourself with the issue:

1. Comment out the following line in the example project's [ClientSideApi/GridView.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/ClientSideApi/GridView.aspx) file:

   ```aspx
   <SettingsDataSecurity AllowEdit="False" AllowInsert="False" AllowDelete="False" AllowReadUnexposedColumnsFromClientApi="False" />
   ```

2. Open this page in the browser and click the **DeleteRow(0)** button or type the following code in the browser's console:

   ```js
   >gridView.DeleteRow(0)
   ```

   ![Templates - Sanitized Content](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/unauthorized-client-crud.png?raw=true)

   This will delete a data row with the index 0. This is possible because the Grid View's data source still provides access to the Delete statement and the grid's `SettingsDataSecurity.AllowDelete` property is set to the default `True` value.

The best practices to mitigate this vulnerability are:

- If you intend to use a grid-based control in view-only mode, make sure that its data source does not allow data editing (for example a SqlDataSource does not have DeleteCommand, InsertCommand and UpdateCommand).

- Disable CRUD operations on the control level using the control's [SettingsDataSecurity](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxGridView.SettingsDataSecurity) property:

  ```aspx
  <SettingsDataSecurity AllowEdit="False" AllowInsert="False" AllowDelete="False" />
  ```

### 9.2. Using Spreadsheet in Read-Only Mode

If you intend the Spreadsheet control to work in read-only mode (the `SettingsView.Mode` option is set to "Reading"), make sure that the ability to switch to edit mode is disabled:

```aspx
<Settings>
    <Behavior SwitchViewModes="Hidden" />
</Settings>
```

It is also recommended that you set the `ReadOnly` property to true:

```cs
spreadsheet.ReadOnly="true"
```

See the example projects [ClientSideApi/SpreadsheetReadingModeOnly.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/ClientSideApi/SpreadsheetReadingModeOnly.aspx) page.

### 9.3 File Selector Commands in the ReachEdit and Spreadsheet

Related Controls: [ASPxReachEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/17721/aspnet-webforms-controls/rich-text-editor), [ASPxSpreadsheet](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/16157/aspnet-webforms-controls/spreadsheet)

In one of the popular use case scenarios, the ReachEdit or Spreadsheet control's **File** tab is hidden to prevent an end-user from accessing the FileSelector's commands (New, Open, Save, etc.) In this case, a document is opened and saved programmatically.

Note that it is not enough to just hide the File tab because the commands from this tab can still be executed using JavaScript or keyboard shortcuts (for example, the Ctrl+O shortcut can invoke the Open dialog).

When you want to disable file-related commands, the best practice is to also disable file operations by disabling the corresponding Behavior options (CreateNew, Open, Save, SaveAs, SwitchViewModes).

##### ASPxSpreadsheet:

```aspx
<dx:ASPxSpreadsheet ID="spreadsheet" runat="server" WorkDirectory="~/App_Data/WorkDirectory">
    <Settings>
        <Behavior CreateNew="Hidden" Open="Hidden" Save="Hidden" SaveAs="Hidden" SwitchViewModes="Hidden"/>
    </Settings>
</dx:ASPxSpreadsheet>

```

##### ASPxRichEdit:

```aspx
<dx:ASPxRichEdit ID="ASPxRichEdit1" runat="server" WorkDirectory="~\App_Data\WorkDirectory">
    <Settings>
        <Behavior CreateNew="Hidden" Open="Hidden" Save="Hidden" SaveAs="Hidden" ></Behavior>
    </Settings>
</dx:ASPxRichEdit>
```

To familiarize yourself with the vulnerability, open the example project's [ClientSideApi/FileSelector.aspx](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/ClientSideApi/OfficeControlsFileOperations.aspx) file and comment out the following line:

```aspx
<Behavior CreateNew="Hidden" Open="Hidden" Save="Hidden" SaveAs="Hidden" SwitchViewModes="Hidden"/>
```

Run the application and open the page. Now, if you press Ctrl+O, the Open dialog will be invoked despite the fact that the File tab is hidden.

## 10. Downloading Files From External URLs

Consider a use-case scenario when an web application receives a URL from an end-user, downloads an image file from this URL and saves the file in a database. This file is then displayed on the application's page using the ASPxBinaryImage control.

It is often suggested to use the WebClient class to download a file in this scenario:

```cs
using(var webClient = new WebClient())
    BinaryImage.ContentBytes = webClient.DownloadData(url);
```

However, this is unsafe because the WebClient can accept a path to a local resource on the server (for example, “c:\...\App_Data\ConfidentialImages\...”), which allows a malefactor to gain access to confidential files (such as web.config, the App_Data folder or other files and folders with nonpublic content).

To mitigate this vulnerability, use HttpWebRequest:

```cs
HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);
using(HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse()) {
    ...
}
```

In this case, an attempt to download a local file will generate an exception.

See the example project's [DownloadingFiles/DownloadFileFromUrl.aspx.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/DownloadingFiles/DownloadFileFromUrl.aspx.cs) file.
